# RL-AMSB: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Adaptive Model Selection and Blending

This repository contains a conceptual implementation of **RL-AMSB**, a framework that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adaptively select and blend machine learning models for healthcare prediction tasks. 

## Key Features

- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**: Provides intermediate explanations for each model selection step.
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** Formulation: Encodes dataset statistics and model complexity into states and actions.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Learns an optimal policy for model selection or blending.
- **Penalty for Complexity**: Ensures the framework balances predictive performance and computational overhead.

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repo:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/RL-AMSB.git
   cd RL-AMSB
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies** (e.g., via pip):
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. **(Optional)** Create a virtual environment:
   \`\`\`bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   \`\`\`

## Usage

- **Step 1**: Place your Kaggle or Hugging Face dataset in `data/` or modify the load paths.
- **Step 2**: Run the RL script:
  \`\`\`bash
  python scripts/run_rl_model_selection.py
  \`\`\`
- **Step 3**: Observe the training output logs which detail reward convergence and model selections.

## Training Output (Example)

Below is a snippet of the final training logs showing stable convergence:
